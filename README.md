# 4-in-a-Row Game

A classic two-player connection game similar to Connect Four, where players drop colored discs into a vertical grid, aiming to connect four of their own discs consecutively - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Game Description

In this implementation, players take turns dropping their colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own discs wins the game.
