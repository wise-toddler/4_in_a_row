# Connect 4 Game - MVP Development Plan

## Problem Analysis & Purpose
Create an engaging, mobile-friendly Connect 4 web game that provides a smooth and intuitive gaming experience without backend dependencies. The game targets casual players looking for a quick two-player game on any device.

## Core Features
### Essential Features
- 7x6 responsive game grid
- Two-player turn-based gameplay
- Real-time win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Piece dropping with physics-based animation
- Win state highlighting
- Game restart functionality
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Standout Feature
- **Physics-Based Drop Animation**: Instead of a simple linear animation, pieces will fall with realistic physics simulation, including slight bouncing and acceleration, making the game feel more dynamic and engaging.

## UI Design Focus
- Clean, minimalist interface with bold colors
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Clear visual feedback for player turns
- Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
- Large, touch-friendly hit areas for mobile
- Subtle shadows and depth effects for visual interest
- Victory celebration animation

## MVP Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Use bulk_file_writer)
1. Initialize React project with Vite
2. Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
3. Create basic project structure
4. Implement basic component scaffolding

### Phase 2: Core Game Board (Use bulk_file_writer)
5. Create game board grid component
6. Implement basic cell components
7. Add player turn management
8. Basic piece placement logic

### Phase 3: Game Logic (Switch to str_replace_editor)
9. Implement win detection algorithm
10. Add game state management
11. Create restart game functionality
12. Add win state highlighting

### Phase 4: Animation & Styling (Use str_replace_editor)
13. Add physics-based dropping animation
14. Implement responsive design
15. Style game board and pieces
16. Add turn indicators and status messages

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
17. Add victory celebration effects
18. Implement touch event handling
19. Add sound effects (optional)
20. Cross-browser testing and bug fixes

## Development Guidelines
- Use bulk_file_writer for initial setup and basic components (first 8 steps)
